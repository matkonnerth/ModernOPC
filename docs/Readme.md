* suppport creating Objects from Object types
As a developer I want to load a nodeset with the ObjectType of a service.
When I create an instance of this ObjectType, I want to bind it to the service implmentation.
* support user defined datatypes:
  * structures
  * enumerations
* refactor Variant handling
  * hack in open library is necessary to forward declare UA_Variant in Variant.h
* tests for nodeset import
* benchmark tests
